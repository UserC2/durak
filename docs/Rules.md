# Durak Rules

## Setup
* 2-5 players (6 possible but suboptimal)
* Played with 1 standard 52-card deck with cards 2-5 removed.
* Each player is dealt six cards.
* A trump card is drawn from the deck after dealing, placed face up.
* The deck is placed on top of the trump card at 90° so the trump card remains visible.

## Gameplay
### Card Ranking:
* (High –> Low) A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6
* Trump suit beats all non-trump suit cards

### Turn Structure:
Starting:
* The player with the lowest trump card is the first attacker.
* The player to the attacker's left is the defender (turn order is clockwise).

Each Turn:
* The attacker begins an attack round, and the defender defends against it (see Attacking & Defending). Other players may join the attack round.
* If the defence succeeds:
  * The defender becomes the new attacker.
  * All attack and defence cards are placed in the discard pile.
* If the defence fails:
  * Starting with the last attacker and continuing clockwise, each player (except the defender) is given the opportunity to shed cards matching the rank of any cards played during that round, up to a maximum of six cards (including any attack cards played).
  * The defender picks up all attack, defence, and shedded cards.
  * The defender's turn is skipped, and the player to their left becomes the new attacker.
* Starting with the attacker, and continuing clockwise, any player that has less than six cards draws from the deck until they have six cards, or the deck, including the original trump card, runs out.

Ending:
* Once a player has no cards in their hand and the deck has run out, they stop playing.
* The last player with cards remaining in their hand loses, and is declared the "durak" (fool).

### Attacking & Defending
* Attacking and defending takes place in "rounds".
* The round ends with a successful defence when the defender beats against all the attacks launched against them.
* The round ends with a failed defence if a defender cannot or does not want to defend against an attack.

Single Attack:
* The attacker places a card in front of the defender to begin an attack.
  > Attack cards are placed in a row in front of the defender.
* The defender must beat the attack by playing a higher-value card of the same suit, or by playing a card of the trump suit.
  * If the attack card is of the trump suit, the defender must play a higher card of the trump suit.
  > Defence cards are placed partially overlapping attack cards at 90°, so both are visible.

Additional Attacks:
* Once an attack is defended against, players are given the opportunity to launch a new attack, starting with the attacker and continuing clockwise.
* Players can choose to launch a new attack, or pass the opportunity to the next player.
* The attack round ends once no players are willing to attack, six attacks have been launched, or the defence has failed.

## Options
Siege Durak:
* The attacker may launch the first attack with multiple cards of the same rank. Instead of attacking in order, any player may add on to the attack at any time.

Railway Durak:
* The entire deck, except for one trump card, is dealt to the players. Players cannot draw additional cards.

Transferrable Durak:
* If no defence has been attempted yet, the defender can pass the attack clockwise by playing a card of the same rank as the attacking card.
* The player to their left becomes the new defender, and the original defender becomes the new attacker.
* A player who has an attack passed to them may pass an attack to the next player using the same method.

Wait for first defence:
* If Siege Durak is enabled, prevents players from attacking until the defender beats the first attack.
