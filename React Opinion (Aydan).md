# React Opinion (Aydan)
We spent a lot of time doing stuff didn't work at all, which we could've used to work on alternative ideas (such as using a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen instead of trying to switch between pages).

I really didn't have much experience with React or read the docs thoroughly, so I had no idea how to implement most functionality (and when I tried to consult the docs for help I couldn't find anything particularily helpful).

For example, I tried to find out how to switch between pages with a button press in React, but only found recommendations on libraries to use. I avoided them because it seemed like there should've been a better way to do it within React, however there wasn't.

What I liked:
* JSX was easy to learn (since it's HTML).

What I disliked:
* Some things I tried to do weren't possible the way I thought I should do them, so I wasted time unsuccessfully implementing them
* I wasn't able to accomplish very much compared to the speed I could do things in Figma or Python. I spent most of my time trying to figure out how React worked rather than programming anything.
* Using component state was confusing.
